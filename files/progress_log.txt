PROGRESS

WEEKS 9-10
    - Created project + set up Git
    - Simple window + animation in ScalaFx
    - Matrix4 and Vec4 -classes
        + simple arithmetic operations
        + affine transformation matrices
    - Quaternion (for rotations)
    - Add rotating triangle using my matrix-libraries

    problems:
    - the scene won't take values "width" and "height" as parameters
    - testing with points and lines proved unnecessary

    timetable:
    - on time


WEEKS 11-12
    - Perspective full implementation + fix
    - Rendering has been moved to the Object -class
    - Cube-object (hardcoded version for testing)
    - OBJ cube + monkey + donut imported from Blender (see "resources")
    - Added file parser
        - Is still missing error handling
    - Minor other additions + improvements (Vec4 asserts ect.)
    - Random transparent color implementation for debugging

    problems:
    - mutable collections necessary -> using ArrayBuffers in certain places (performance reasons)
    - decided to remove the "Point" class
        -> provides nothing necessary and makes whole build too complicated
    - parsing looks a bit different than initially planned, the core idea is still roughly the same
    - "cheating" with the colors:
        - the rendering does not care about the z-axis -> the wrong things are on top
            - this will be later fixed with the surfaces normal-vector implementation and rendering only the necessary
              triangles (normal vector facing the camera)
        - is now using 50% transparent "randomly" chosen colors (see "Object -> render" and "AllColors.java")
        - this transparency-solution allows me to see more clearly what exactly is going on
    - UML's "Mesh" and "Object" are currently one class, might be split later
    - negative coordinates cause wrong rendering (when behind the camera)
        -> must implement near clipping plane in the future

    timetable:
    - changed the order of implementation (obj reader before point light)
        - While I was working on the project, I realized that this new order seems more natural. The removal of
          of a separate "Point" -class also influenced this decision.
    - made progress, even though my scheduling hasn't been so great (life and other things)
