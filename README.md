# 3D Viewer

This is a 3D Wavefront OBJ file viewer written in Scala. The program 
uses a self-written simple 3D library for software rendering and 
ScalaFX for drawing. There are different types of light sources illuminating
the object, and it is possible for the user to roam the virtual
scene freely.

This was initially a project for a university course.

Special thanks to [@twelho](https://github.com/twelho) for guiding me
